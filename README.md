## üìä Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a centralized dashboard to monitor EC2 instances across multiple AWS accounts. The solution consists of:

- **Amazon S3:** Hosting a static website to display instance data.
- **AWS Lambda:** Collecting compliance data periodically.
- **AWS CloudFormation:** Automating the deployment of IAM roles, Lambda functions, and EventBridge rules.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- An **AWS Management Account** for creating and configuring the S3 bucket.
- Appropriate **permissions** to create IAM roles, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, EventBridge rules, and perform CloudFormation deployments.
- **AWS CLI** or access to the AWS Management Console.
- An S3 bucket name following the convention:  
  `swoec2monitoringwebapp-{client-name}`
- **Static Website Hosting** enabled on S3 with proper CORS and bucket policies.

---

## üîß Deployment Steps

### 1. Create S3 Bucket üì¶

- **Create the Bucket:**  
  In your management account, create an S3 bucket named using the format:  
  `swoec2monitoringwebapp-{client-name}`
- **Public Access:**  
  Make the bucket public by unchecking the "Block Access" box.
- **Enable Static Website Hosting:**  
  Activate static website hosting for the bucket.

---

### 2. Static Website Hosting Configuration üåê

- **Index Document:** Set to `index.html`.
- **Error Document:** Set to `error.html`.

---

### 3. CORS Configuration üîÑ

In the bucket permissions, add the following CORS configuration:

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
