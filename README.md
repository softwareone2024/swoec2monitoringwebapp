## üìä Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a centralized dashboard to monitor EC2 instances across multiple AWS accounts. The solution consists of:

- **Amazon S3:** Hosting a static website to display instance data.
- **AWS Lambda:** Collecting compliance data periodically.
- **AWS CloudFormation:** Automating the deployment of IAM roles, Lambda functions, and EventBridge rules.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- An **AWS Management Account** for creating and configuring the S3 bucket.
- Appropriate **permissions** to create IAM roles, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, EventBridge rules, and perform CloudFormation deployments.
- **AWS CLI** or access to the AWS Management Console.
- An S3 bucket name following the convention:  
  `swoec2monitoringwebapp-{client-name}`
- **Static Website Hosting** enabled on S3 with proper CORS and bucket policies.

---

## üîß Deployment Steps

### 1. Create S3 Bucket üì¶

- **Create the Bucket:**  
  In your management account, create an S3 bucket named using the format:  
  `swoec2monitoringwebapp-{client-name}`
- **Public Access:**  
  Make the bucket public by unchecking the "Block Access" box.
- **Enable Static Website Hosting:**  
  Activate static website hosting for the bucket.

---

### 2. Static Website Hosting Configuration üåê

- **Index Document:** Set to `index.html`.
- **Error Document:** Set to `error.html`.

---

### 3. CORS Configuration üîÑ

In the bucket permissions, add the following CORS configuration:

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]

4. Bucket Policy Configuration üîí

Initial Policy: Allow public GET access:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::swoec2monitoringwebapp-{client-name}/*"
        }
    ]
}

	Note: After deploying CloudFormation, update the bucket policy to include permissions for Lambda functions to write to the bucket:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::swoec2monitoringwebapp-{client-name}/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role/SWOEC2MonitoringAppRole" },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::swoec2monitoringwebapp-{client-name}/*"
        }
        // Additional statements for other accounts...
    ]
}

5. Upload Static Website Files üì§

Upload the following files to your S3 bucket:
	‚Ä¢	ec2monitoringwebcft.yaml (CloudFormation template)
	‚Ä¢	index.html
	‚Ä¢	script.js
	‚Ä¢	styles.css

	Tip: Ensure script.js (e.g., on line 3) references the correct file names for the JSON data generated by the Lambda functions. For example:

const fileNames = [
    'instance-info-123456789012-us-east-1.json',
    'instance-info-098765432123-sa-east-1.json',
    // Additional entries for other accounts...
];

6. Deploy CloudFormation Template ‚òÅÔ∏è

Deploy the CloudFormation template (cftec2monitoring.yaml) using Stack Set:
	‚Ä¢	Stack Name: SWOEC2MonitoringAppStack
	‚Ä¢	Parameters: Provide the S3 bucket name and management account details.

This template will create the necessary IAM roles, Lambda functions, and EventBridge rules.

7. Post-Deployment Configurations üîÑ

For each AWS account where resources were deployed:
	‚Ä¢	Environment Variables:
In the Lambda function settings, set the ACCOUNT_NAME environment variable to a friendly name for the account.
	‚Ä¢	Test the Lambda Function:
Create a test event (with default values) and run the function once to generate the initial JSON data file in the S3 bucket.

üîê Permissions Overview
	‚Ä¢	S3 Bucket Permissions:
	‚Ä¢	Public access: s3:GetObject
	‚Ä¢	IAM roles (from each monitored account) require s3:PutObject permissions.
	‚Ä¢	IAM Roles:
Each AWS account must have the SWOEC2MonitoringAppRole with permissions to invoke the Lambda function and interact with S3.

‚öôÔ∏è Lambda Function Variables
	‚Ä¢	BUCKET_NAME:
The name of the S3 bucket where data is uploaded (configured via CloudFormation).
	‚Ä¢	ACCOUNT_NAME:
A friendly name for the AWS account used in the dashboard.

üìå Summary

Following these steps will ensure a successful deployment of the AWS EC2 Monitoring Web Application:
	‚Ä¢	Amazon S3: Hosts the static website.
	‚Ä¢	AWS Lambda: Collects and uploads compliance data.
	‚Ä¢	AWS CloudFormation: Automates the deployment process.

By carefully following the instructions‚Äîespecially those regarding permissions and bucket configurations‚Äîyou‚Äôll achieve a robust and scalable monitoring solution.
